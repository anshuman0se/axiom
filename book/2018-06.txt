An alternative approach, and the one I actually use, is to install
VirtualBox,
boot Ubuntu and install Axiom with

   apt-get install axiom

This has the advantage that you can stop work in the middle of a session,
save the virtual machine, and later restart the virtual machine and be back
in the middle of your session.
