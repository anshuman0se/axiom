Subject: [Axiom-developer] [Axiom] Progress report

Last night I finished adding Chapter 8 to Axiom's Volume 10.1
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_(computer_algebra_system)
based on Andreas' PhD thesis. His TeX sources greatly simplified
the task.

The Visiting Scholar position allowed me to complete the necessary
background library work quickly. It also gave me access to a rich
collection of further research leads.

This chapter will form the skeleton for the next phase of research on
proving Axiom correct. This next phase will focus on the overall plan
of attack.

I am open to suggestions about what conference might be the best
forum for publishing papers on this subject.

Thank you.
Tim

I would suggest the ITP, which in 2018 is part of FLoC.
There is also ISSAC, more traditionally in computer algebra.

Subject: [Axiom-developer] Axiom for Windows 32 / 64 bit

=E2=80=8B=E2=80=8B
Dear Prof. Timothy Daly,

For our research work with some basic symbolic computations calculus
and Diophantine equations solving, we wish to download Axiom for windows 32
/ 64  bit.
But its difficult to install for windows platform.
Kindly let us know, if any Axiom installer file is compiled for windows
installation.
Secondly kindly en light us, how Axiom can be compared with wxMaxima in
terms of such CAS, since we are switching over from Mathematica due to some
off campus license issues.


Thank you

With regards,
Dr M Kanagasabapathy

Axiom is distributed for Windows using Docker.
You can install docker here:
https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#download-docker-for-windows

You can run Axiom using

   docker pull daly/axiom  (only needed the first time)
   docker run -i -t daly/axiom axiom



re: Maxima

Maxima is an excellent piece of software. I have no opinion about
whether it will fit your needs. From the changelog it appears that
there have been no changes since 2005:

They switched to version-numbered change log files around then.  For example, the latest appears to be:

Thank you for your guidance.
>From google I came to know Axiom is relatively powerful. But unfortunately
installation on Windows platform is so difficult for novices.
My students feel that still installation of Axiom in windows is cumbersome
and we have licensed Windows OS (both 7 & 8) only.
And parallel version friCAS has windows installation.
May I request is it possible to compile Axiom as .exe format for Windows
with  single click installation like friCAS or wxMaxima so as Windows users
can install it easily.
Regards,
Dr M Kanagasabapathy

Dr. Kanagasabapathy,

I am happy that you found a solution that fits your needs.

CY,

I have not been tracking Maxima so I did not notice the new method of
tracking changes. I did an insufficiently detailed search for the Maxima
changelog in response to the request. Mea Culpa.
