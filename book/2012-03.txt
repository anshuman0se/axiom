Subject: Axiom March 2012 Release

March 2012 Release

A new volume, Volume 8.1, the Axiom Gallery shows examples of Axiom
graphics. These are test cases being collected to show capabilities
of the graphics subsystems.

One of the outstanding graphics bugs was 7217 which gave odd values
for graphics labels. This was fixed by picking up Waldek's patch for
coercion to InputForm. This had the unfortunate side effect that a
large number of Axiom's 35,000 test cases needed to be updated.

A particularly interesting article on Literate Programming and
Reproducible Research was published in the Journal of Statistical
Software and was added to the documentation page.
(http://www.jstatsoft.org/v46/i03/paper)

There are two new commands, )tangle and )regress.

A new function, getAncestors was added to the API domain.

The buglist was published and several bugs were added.

New references to Axiom were added to the bibliography, including
Dav12, Jen79, Dav80

Several people contributed to this release, including James Davenport,
Mark Clements, George Legendre, and Waldek Hebisch
