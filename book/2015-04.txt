Subject: [Axiom-developer] New Docker Image

There is a new docker image. It now has all of the messages
inlined in the code. The change should be transparent.

As usual:

   docker pull daly/axiom
   docker run -i -i daly/axiom axiom

Subject: [Axiom-developer] How to code an assumption in axiom

Hi -

How can I code an assumption in axiom?

In my case, I'm analyzing a polynomial differential equation.  I want to
compute the order of a polynomial at a factor, which is the power of the
factor that appears in the polynomial.

For example, consider D(f,x), where f is some unspecified polynomial.  I
want to write a function "ord" and compute ord(D(f,x), ifac), where ifac is
some unspecified irreducible factor.  I can't do this calculation with the
information given.  However, if I assert that ord(f, ifac) > 0, then
ord(D(f,x), ifac) = ord(f, ifac) - 1.

In other words, differentiation causes the order of an irreducible factor
to drop by one, but only if the factor was actually present in the original
polynomial.

Any suggestions how to write this in axiom?
