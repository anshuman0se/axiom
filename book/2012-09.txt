Hello Waldek, hello Tim,

in FriCAS, I find a file src/hyper/pages/HEAP.ht with a header

% Copyright The Numerical Algorithms Group Limited 1992-94. All rights
reserved.
% !! DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE BY HAND !! Created by ht.awk.

But there isn't any ht.awk in the repository.

I suppose this was created before AXIOM became free, i.e. the .ht files
are currently TRUE sources not generated from anything else and THEY are
used to generate the HyperDoc content.

Also in the AXIOM sources git://github.com/daly/axiom.git it looks as if
the .ht file is SOURCE (it's embedded in books/bookvol7.1.pamphlet
without this "!! DO NOT MODIFY" warning.

In the AXIOM sources I get the following.

grep -nH -Re 'implements a priority' *

books/bookvol7.1.pamphlet:31297:The domain \spadtype{Heap(S)} implements
a priority queue of objects
books/bookvol0.pamphlet:32428:The domain {\tt Heap(S)} implements a
priority queue of objects of
books/bookvol10.3.pamphlet:53913:The domain Heap(S) implements a
priority queue of objects of type S
src/axiom-website/hyperdoc/axbook/section-9.32.xhtml:27:<p>The domain
<span class="teletype">Heap(S)</span> implements a priority queue of
objects of
t

where only the first looks like a true source and the others look pretty
much generated. I wonder why the .help file isn't generated from the .ht
source.

Tim, do you know how the HEAP.ht file was originally generated. I
suppose there must have been sources that didn't include the output of
the AXIOM commands.

BTW, is there anywhere a good description of HyperTex. I faintly
remember that I have once seen a list of all the commands available in
HyperTex.

Has there ever been any attempt to define the HyperTex-commands in a
.sty file and then process the .ht files via LaTeX?

Well, I wrote about this on 10 Sep 2008 in replay to Martin Rubey
and on 23 Sep 2009 in replay to you (I have copies of the messages
on my machine, presumably one should be able to find then in
Google archive but the Google interface is so ugly that I leave
this to desperate enough).

Anyway I wrote:
 
: We can recreate those pages, but this process in not integrated into
: Makefiles.  The tools need are on image of NAG cdrom (the one that
: Tim posted some time ago).  You can get the whole image at:

: 
: The programs are in the subdirectory cdrom/development/src/htex
: and the page sources are in the subdirectory

The Hyperdoc pages about HyperTex?  I have read them and they seem
quite accurate.
