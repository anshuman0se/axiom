Subject: [Axiom-developer] Guido steps down after community turmoil

https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-committers/2018-July/005664.html

Apparently he found it exhausting that "so many people despise my
decisions".
Note the choice of words: 'despise', not 'disagree'. You can feel the sense
of
being under personal attack.

He writes: So what are you all going to do? Create a democracy? Anarchy? A
dictatorship? A federation? I'll still be here, but I'm trying to let you
all figure
something out for yourselves. I'm tired, and need a very long break.

You can feel the stress he is under. He has spent years on Python,
not only as a author but as the PRIMARY author.

I have memories of writing a similar email. I do not envy him.

As the saying goes, "You can tell the leader. He's the one with all the
arrows in his back."

I wish him peace.

Tim

You can get the sources at
http://github.com/daly/axiom

The PDFs are available at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_(computer_algebra_system)

You can get an executable on Linux with
sudo apt-get install axiom

You can get an executable on all platforms using Docker:
docker pull daly/axiom
docker run -i -t daly/axiom axiom

Subject: [Axiom-developer] Sum infinite series

In the src/input directory there are test cases which show various
sum expressions, including infinite series,

limit(sum(1/k^2 + 1/k^3, k=1..n), n=%plusInfinity)

I'm not sure I understand your comment about biographies. The only mention
of biographies is from the source code of the original Jenks book. The book
was written by quite a few people, although only 2 people's names are on the
cover. Buy a copy of the original book and you'll see them. I'm not sure why
you feel that giving the authors credit for their work is "egotistical".
Books
universally mention their authors.

If you're making reference to the obituaries, they are people who spent
a large portion of their life making Axiom exist. Two pages in a PDF seems
a small price to pay to acknowledge them.

The table of contents uses hyperlinks so you can avoid them if you wish.

Axiom's current algorithms don't solve your problem, it seems. However,
Axiom is open source. You understand your problem. Please write an
algorithm to solve it and contribute it to Axiom. We welcome such
contributions.

In fact, writing a new or updated algorithm will add your name to the
contributors.
We are extremely careful to give credit to people who help.

Interesting, you want some CAS to solve your problem
(btw, you have not even clearly stated what you wanted to get as a
result), but you seem to believe that you get your solution for free.
For Mathematica you have to pay money for it. For open source CAS, you
don't have to pay money, but it would make sense to pay at least some
respect to the authors and their work.

If you can implement all those algorithms yourself, why don't you write
your own CAS and opensource it for other people to use? Then wait until
someone comes and says, "your CAS cannot do X and the documentation only
mentions your name and a long biography". You'll probably like that. ;-)

I don't think that people keep willing to help you.

Good luck. I'm waiting for your CAS to arrive.

Ralf
