I'm trying to prove Axiom correct.

Axiom draws its power from organizing algorithms based on group
theory, adding propositions as the complexity increases. This helps
\begin{verbatim}limit the assumptions needed to provide algorithms.

Recently I've learned a bit about substructural and (super?) structural
logics. So, for example, given the propositions
   (W) Weakening
   (C)  Contraction
   (E)  Exchange
they can be combined to form (Crary):
     W &  C  &  E ==> Persistant logic.
     W & ~C &  E ==> Affine logic
   ~W &  C  &  E ==> Strict logic
   ~W & ~C &  E ==> Linear logic
     W &   C & ~E ==> ?
     W & ~C & ~E ==> ?
   ~W &   C & ~E ==> ?
   ~W & ~C & ~E ==> Ordered logic

In addition, there appears to be a group theory-like organization of
logics above the substructural e.g. predicate, simply-typed lambda,
and lambda calculus (Avigad).

Organizing these logics by the gradual introduction of propositions
and properties would fit exactly into Axiom's structure and make
proof assumptions clear. I want to organize these in Axiom so the
proofs inherit the required logic.

Can you give me any references to a group-theory-like organization
of the various logics, similar to the above? I have done a literature
search but have not found anything yet.

Thank you.
Tim Daly

Florian,

As I mentioned, over the break I'm trying to climb the
substructural logic hill. It looks particularly interesting.

Axiom is based on group theory. It splits into two parts
"categories" (not category theory) which are collections of
signatures and "domains" which are implementations of
signatures.

So in Axiom you start with Set or Type and then define
things like Group (which requires more singatures), Rings,
(more required signatures), Fields (e.g. a division signature).

Once the tower of categories exists you can define a
domain that inherits from some (sub-)tower. Now you have
to write code to implement each of the inherited signatures.

This gives Axiom a very useful way of organizing along the
lines of group theory.



Using my own form of reasoning (unreasonable analogy) it
must be possible to organize substructural logic into a set
of categories that can be organized in a similar way.

So, by analogy, it should be possible to start a root category
with a "reflexive signature" A |- A

Then a set of categories can be defined, one each, to allow
structural rules like Weakening which you might or might not
allow.

Then a set of categories with specific introduction and
elimination rules (e.g. one for ->I, ->E for implication)

Organized in this granular fashion one can then create
something like a LinearLogic, OrderedLogic,  or a Gentzen
domain that inherits only the categories that apply.

Clearly Halleck's work
http://www.cc.utah.edu/~nahaj/logic/structures/index.html
both supports this idea and shows that it is too simplistic
to really cover all of logic. But for a reasonable subset such
as I will need while proving Axiom it seems that the naive
organization might be sufficient.



Just after our attempted phone call two books showed up
"An Introduction to Substructural Logics" and
"Abstract Algeraic Logic: An Introductory Textbook".

I'm part way through the first book and it looks like it
supports the organization I'm postulating. The second
book, at first glance, looks like Font has already done the
organizational work I need. It is, however, a much slower read.




Even more interesting is that Avigad's Proof Theory course
showed that there are logics of equivalent power but different
levels of expression. This seems to me to imply that there is
a form of automated coercion that must exist between various
logics that can be constructed.

Axiom does automatic coercions in its group theory setting.
These really complicate the Type Theory reasoning I'm trying
to use. At the moment I'm quite confused about coercion so
I may have to do a survey paper to try to get a grip on the topic.

Tim
