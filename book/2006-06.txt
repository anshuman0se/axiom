Well, I don't get this point, but I have to admit, I have no

Sorry, no success: )lib nputs.o gives me ")library cannot find the file

NPUTS is unbound".

I am thinking of importing defentry into Aldor to define the C command
to Lisp. Something like
-------------
import {defentry: (??) -> ?} from Foreign Lisp;

-- call imported defentry to declare C command to underlying Lisp
defentry("printf","string","int");
-------------
Obviously the give syntax wont work. But you could move the Lisp
defentry into Aldor.

"package" is a name space concept in common lisp. The
package name becomes part of the full name of a symbol
like this:

  BOOT::myprintf

BOOT is the name space used by Axiom.

When Aldor code is compiled in Axiom the symbols default to
a different package, therefore you must use the full name to
call myprint. In Aldor the : must be escaped by _ so it looks
rather messy

  BOOT_:_:myprintf

Of course there might be other ways to accomplish this. Maybe
someone more knowledgeable about lisp could help?

That's my confusion. I think what you need is (compiler::link ...)
but that is beyond my level of competitence with GCL. Lisp
users please help!

I think you are right that Aldor should probably generate the
defentry but foreign language interface is still not that
standard in lisp, so what Aldor does might not be too portable.
Since the current versiono of open source Axiom uses gcl, the
foreign call mechanism would have to be compatible with this.

Although I still cannot call this routine as an external
library routine, I was able to compile and call it from
inside Axiom. See my extended example at:

GCL is actually at a bit of a disadvantage here, at least from a
standards point of view.  CFFI is becoming the "de-facto" standard Lisp
FFI, or at least is doing better at it than any previous effort.  GCL
doesn't yet support CFFI - I'm not sure if it requires ANSI to have a
hope of functioning but I wouldn't be surprised.

An interesting aside is the SWIG tool can apparently be used to
generate CFFI bindings for some libraries - http://www.swig.org/  I
don't know if this is particularly helpful to Axiom, but it is
certainly an interesting option to have available.

Looks ok, aside from the fact that you assume that axiom's
representation of SI and String are the same as lisp's - probably true,
but it may be better to uniformly use SExpression as the argument and
return types.

I think 'Foreign C' and 'Foreign Lisp' are treated identically when
generating lisp code - ideally either the compiler would generate an
error or produce the appropriate defentry when generating lisp for a
Foreign C symbol. 

I also have a vague recollection of being able to specify a package name
as part of the import - ie.
import { ... } from Foreign Lisp("BOOT");
but I may be confusing that with something else.  In any case, making
this more friendly may be possible with a bit of creative tinkering in
the aldor code.

No idea about loading external libraries..

Thanks for explaining this issue. Where/how did you place the defentry
line. It didn't work out for me with )lisp ?!

Well, I never tried to use Lisp before using Axiom. What I found
googleing for compiler::link where examples generating a new lisp image
including addtional libs. Maybe it is possible to call functions from
this one??
My second idea was to use the dynamic loader (Linux: dlopen from libdl;
FreeBSD includes dlopen in libc), to load a missing library (converted
to from my custom object).
Actually Lisp told me, "dlopen" is not in the base image :-(
At least I expected it to be, because it is in libc.

faslink and FFI are not implemented in GCL (and/or Linux/BSD/...)

Great. 

My idea of doing all that is to be able to integrate external libraries
into Axiom/Aldor. And there are plenty interesting candidates (e.g.
LAPACK, SDPA, ...)

This should read 

)lisp (load "nputs.o")

On this page

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxAldorForeign

the (defentry ... ) line is between

 \begin{lisp}
 ...
 \end{lisp}

which means that it gets compiled into the current Axiom/Lisp image.

Yes. As Tim Daly said, the best person and place to ask about this
is Camm Maguire and gcl-devel@gnu.org but
Camm does also read this list so I hope he has time to reply.

I think that is the right idea. As I understand it gcl can be
compiled with dlopen as an option but I don't know anything more
about it than that.

augh. perhaps if/when we switch to an open source aldor. 
i'd rather not take another 6 months away from my current work
just to recode the system into a different literate form without
adding additional content. i'd rather the process be incremental
as we recode in aldor and write documentation for the domains.

i am, however, willing to try to use ALLPROSE if someone is willing
to do the patches to the makefiles to integrate the ALLPROSE machinery
as well as rewriting one of the files into ALLPROSE. That's a big task.

an even more useful subtask would be to recode the literate tool into aldor.
then we can use and enhance our own literate tool without requiring the
awk/gawk/nawk/sed/perl/C pile.

it might be easier to accomplish an ALLPROSE rewrite once i finish the
next release of volume 4 of the books. in response to a criticism,
i've been trying to update the "developer's guide" (volume 4) to
include a detailed description of the build process. once that
completes i'm going to clean up volume 4 some more and add it to the
release. of course, adding ALLPROSE means rewriting this description
but that will have to happen anyway.




> Is there a plan how to convince stephen watt to free aldor at the Bronstein
> conference?

a plan? is begging a plan? i suspect Stephen has already worked on trying to 
open source Aldor. he knows there is interest and he is aware of the
petition page. because there are legal issues to check it can take time.
NAG took a long time from first request (august 2000) to release (sept 2001)
and they have a dedicated legal team. from the outside it always looks like
nothing is happening but i've spent months chasing the legal permission path
for some of the axiom documentation (e.g. thesis work, bronstein's latest
work, etc.). the legal process has a glacial quality about it.

i do plan to talk to Stephen and Mike about it at ISSAC.

perhaps with Stephen's permission NAG could dual-license the aldor sources
so they use the Modified BSD like the rest of the system. Mike Dewar might
have an opinion on this path. i haven't seen the contract between them so
i'm not sure if it includes an 'exclusive' clause. if not NAG should be
free to dual-license it. if so, Stephen's permission should be enough to
modify the contract provided it was in writing. if the copyrights transferred
in toto, which did not happen with Axiom, then Stephen has the full rights
to the copyright. i was not privy to any of these discussions.

there is no such thing as a simple job.

Very likely I confused

so patch is confused now... Usually patch says something like

if you say "yes", it should work out...

Forget about SPAD, go for Aldor. The formal description of aldor starts on page
239 (Chapter 22) of the Aldor User Guide. Christian Aistleitner once pointed
out that it is not completely correct, you have to ask him for details. (He
even wrote a parser for Aldor in Aldor once, so he knows...)

The SPAD grammar should be more or less a subset of Aldor. But again: forget
about SPAD.

The source code of the Aldor compiler is not available; SPAD's is.  I
heard there are talks tomove on that front, but how long we have to wait.
I cannot tell my students to wait till next year or so.
Yes, of course I can initiate a mini project where where they will

base code and add transformations or type system convenient features.

A very useful project -- of course, I don't know whether it fits your needs --
would be the following:

The Aldor interpreter is very weak, it segfaults quite often, it has no way to
figure out "likely" types and so on.

So maybe, you and your students could figure out how to make the axiom
interpreter do the type guessing etc., but then call the aldor compiler,
instead of using SPAD. (If this description is too vague, please complain!)

The benefit would be that we would have Aldors power available at the
interpreter level.

I guess you know already that SPAD has various shortcomings, the two major ones
probably being: 

* Types are not first class objects (i.e., no Lists of Types), 

* SPAD doesn't have truly dependent types.

Tim, there is nothing really fancy about ALLPROSE. There is no need to 
rewrite lots of text. It uses Noweb and the documentation is compiled 
through TeX so what do you fear?

However, there are a few things that have to be done until something 
like ALLPROSE can be applied to the Axiom sources.

1) ALLPROSE is currently made to support programming libraries written 
in Aldor. That basically says that it would first of all apply to the 
ALGEBRA subdirectory of Axiom. And it is probably best suited if it is 
applied during the translation/documenation of SPAD to Aldor.

2) ALLPROSE adds a few LaTeX commands in order to introduce a long 
missing convention of how the ++ comments should be documented.
That means rewriting the ALGEBRA sources and adding documentation in a 
predefined way.

3) ALLPROSE or better some ideas of it could be used also for other 
parts of the Axiom sources, but that will need some more thoughts. I had 
once started it, but got lost into the version control world and then 
had other things to do.

4) ALLPROSE is GPL2.0 and I don't want to change it (currently). So the 
way to go is to include ALLPROSE under the zips directory and add code 
to the Makefiles to extract it to the appropriate place.

I'll do this if I find time. It is certainly a big task for someone not 
so familiar with that machinery. But Tim, I hope you can live with 
another dependency. ALLPROSE heavily uses PERL. Fortunately, I just need 
the standard PERL no additional modules.

If someone is going to do this, then I would very much like to keep as 
compatible as possible to noweb.

Once again, I don't think that adding ALLPROSE means lots of rewriting.
It rather means to group files together to get one big .dvi for each 
group, for example for the algebra or interp directory, instead of one 
.dvi for each .pamphlet file. In the ALLPROSE (documentation) view. 
.pamphlet files are rather considered to be like .tex files that are 
included into a master document. The gain is that one can hyperlink over 
different .pamphlet files (well, of course one has to tag at certain 
places, for example using the \defineterm and \useterm commands.

My personal experience with SPAD was quite painful, dumping pages of sexp as
error message for example.

I am developing my holonomic packages in Aldor with libAxiom and even if
there is still some rough edges the experience is more enjoyable.
The documentation is way better, the compiler as better error message
functionality.

I think the type system need a more formal description, I will like better
inferencing, but as the type system is very complex I am not sure this can
be done soundly.

My CS grad student two cents will go that is better to focus your effort on
Aldor.
I am not sure on how, bringing SPAD up to speed ? A new implementation of
Aldor, maybe just an interpreter ?

I think implementing an Aldor interpreter in one of the ML should be fairly
doable and will be an interesting project due to it's type system( I have no
experience implementing interpreter/compiler in Lisp)

Yes, type inference is of the area that I was thinking of.  Aldor's
requirement of System F-style explicit polymorphism is way too heavy.
We should have syntaxes so that in the simple cases, the system infers
the type -- full type inference in unreasonable and foolish to seek for.

Subject: Call Foreign C from Aldor/Axiom (fwd)

Hi Camm and the Axiom developers, 

I want to summarize my attempts to load external C libraries/functions
from within Aldor/Axiom. I hope a lisp/gcl guru can give me some advice
 - especially on 2.3 ;-) 

1) Functions need to be defined with "defentry" in an external file,
which has to be compiled an loaded. To ")lisp" the defentry does not
work?!
Now, external are known to underlying gcl and the functions can be
called. 

2) Importing external objects or libraries is the actual problem (I hope
only for me): 

2.1: "load" of the object generated from a C src does not work.
2.2: FFI, CFFI, "faslink" is not implemented on Linux, FreeBSD, ... or
GCL at all.
2.3: "compiler::link" generates a new image linked with given shared
libraries  e.g. with libdl providing dlopen to import external shared
libs. This approach is used with elf-loader
(http://www.copyleft.de/lisp) 

I tried to generate an interpsys image with compiler::link instead of
save-system. Yet unlucky, as you can read from the following error
message. I wonder why the compiler::link does not find the gcl libraries
while save-system works?

Ralf, I know you have undertaken a number of times to explain the

archives if my questions have been answered already.  I'm trying for
the "aha!" experience with ALLPROSE's ideas but haven't gotten there
yet.

OK, that jibes with what I understood about ALLPROSE.  Most of our SPAD
literate programming files consist primarily of code at this stage
anyway, so the re-writes of those files will be TRUE rewrites -
incorporating ideas, research paper ideas and references, etc.  In
those conditions incorporating ALLPROSE will be a relatively minor
point.

This is where I start to get a little fuzzy.  I'm still working on the
idea of code chuncks and literate programming (as one look at the Emacs
mode work will clearly show) but I thought the idea of literate
programming was to break things down to the point where the code
chuncks are clearly explained as part of the surrounding context and
don't need any special documentation themselves.  If comments are
included in the programming code as such, they are no more than
convenience notes for someone who doesn't use literate programming at
all (and perhaps a bit of a liability as such, come to think of
it.)ALLPROSE appears to make the distinction between API and user level
documentation (good) but I guess I'm not quite following how this will
work - I tend to view any user level document as distinct from any
detailed discussion of the source/file/program, although I concede this
is not an issue that Axiom as yet has any mechanism at all to handle.

Maybe a better question would be this - is it possible, using ALLPROSE,
to produce a "user handbook" of functionality intended for the user in
each package, and even better a "toplevel" summary of available
packages and their intended functionality?  If so, then I am very much
interested in digging as deep as I can into the ideas of ALLPROSE,
because I currently don't see any way for a user to discover and use
the functionality in a pamphlet except for reading the entire pamphlet,
and that's just not practical in many cases.

When I was using Mathematica in Physics years ago, my biggest single
problem was that I didn't know what I didn't know - e.g. there were
often options for commands that would do what I wanted, but I didn't
know they were there to find, let alone how to use them.  Axiom in some
ways is even worse because it is a CAS with a truly mathematical focus,
as opposed to an engineering focus.  I like this in principle, since at
some level I want to know that those issues we "ignore" in an
engineering problem have in fact been delt with sensibly and are
subject to verification of those solutions, but it makes navigation in
the system a daunting prospect.

Arrgh.  Nothing against perl, but how much work would it be to
re-create the logic of ALLPROSE in Lisp or Aldor?  This might, if done
correctly, resolve the GPL (non?)issue as well, although I personally
am not particularly concerned with that detail (we use GCL, after all.)

In principle this worries me a bit.  I personally like having
individual dvi files for each pamphlet - I had envisioned Axiom
becoming like (eventually) a conference proceeding publication with one
idea+implementation per pamphlet file, and a categorization system
based on the standard categories to make sense of it all.  It might
even tie in with Tim's literate journal idea - as papers are published
they are incorporated into Axiom and become part of both code and
documentation.  A single dvi of the algebra directory, once fully
documented, would be many thousands of pages - I usually would want to
view/print just the particular pamphlet(s) relevant to my current area
of interest.

This is useful for "volumes" of algebra perhaps, but I think viewing
the whole of the algebra directory this way is like trying to consume
the whole salad bar for a meal.  Most people will want only a few bits
of Axiom's literature at any one time.

I was hoping Axiom could become like the best of all worlds in
conference proceedings - grouped by subject with individual ideas
documented in academic paper style, but with those subject groupings
being always coherent and together rather than spread across 10 years
of publications.  Then when compmiled the system will assemble a user
level summary of working commands and functionality based on the
pamphlets in the system at the time, perhaps with examples incorporated
into and also used by the unit test system.

Sorry if I'm misconstruing the idea of ALLPROSE - I know my grasp of it
still isn't there yet.

Cc: Gilbert Baumslag, Jose Mestizo, Wilken Rivera, Yegor Bryukhov

Hello everyone,

Following Mr. Tim Daly's suggestion, I have uploaded a virtual machine
configuration file for the Doyen CD using VMWare.  This should allow to run
the  Doyen CD in different operating systems, especially Windows, allowing
for a more easy demonstration of the Doyen idea and the scientific software
it contains (Axiom, Magnus, CAISS-STAT, LatexWiki).

- The VMWare Player is freely available at
http://www.vmware.com/download/player/

- After having the VMWare player installed you need to download the
DoyenVMWare configuration:

          zip: http://alfredo.axiom-developer.org/doyen/DoyenVmware.zip


          or

          tar: http://alfredo.axiom-developer.org/doyen/DoyenVmware.tar.gz

- After unpacking this file, place the doyen iso image inside the
DoyenVmware directory created. You can download the Doyen iso image at:

          http://alfredo.axiom-developer.org/doyen/doyen-42206.iso

- Using the VMWare player look for the Doyen.vmx file and run it.

Please do not hesitate contacting me if you have any question or if you run
into any problem while downloading any of the packages or running them.

Subject: ToC, eprint.sty, and the Axiom bibliography

A while back we were discussing the problem of a universal Axiom
bibliography and how to handle the issue.  There is still a lot of work
and thinking to be done, but as a first step I have tried to make a
slightly more "bibtex" like bib file for the Axiom pamphlets.  It's not
really all that exciting - the only real improvement so far is that the
authors' names are included - but I am also looking into the previously
discussed ideas of annotations being included with each entry and the
idea of including "standard" references to online databases such as
arXiv.

It turns out there has already been some work done on this, although I
doubt it is integrated with any wiki-like web framework.  I took a stab
at adapting the existing work on annotated bibliographies to what I had
done thus far, achieving no noticable success as yet (bst files are
something of a mystery... sigh.)  However, as long as bst files are on
the menu, I wanted to point out the eprint.sty file at
http://theoryofcomputing.org/submit/eprint/eprint.html

I don't know how significant ToC is in the computer world, but it is
hard to deny they have nice looking setups for their papers.  Their
files appear to be here:
http://theoryofcomputing.org/submit/toctexguide.html#download

These files might be a good starting point for making an advanced
bibliography format for Axiom - I was wondering if anyone knew about
ToC or this format, and had an opinion.  If these folks are fairly
significant they might be a logical partner to work with towards a
common goal of universal bibliography formats and entries.

Subject: Doyen cd with French

Hello,

I tried to use the Doyen Cd, and I met the following problems:

- The password doyen@org is not trivial - first to remember and next
to type with a French keyboard : one has to type Shift+2 to get @, and
so "doyenShift+2org" in order to be able to select the French
keyboard, and the keys typed appear as asterisks of course (since one
has to enter the root password to be able to change keyboard). I would
suggest to hit just Enter, if it is possible ? Otherwise, at least
write the password in the Doyen-Wiki, with the set of keys to be typed
on a French (and other languages) keyboard, in order to change
keyboard config. I think the Doyen wiki is a natural place to look (at
least it is where I looked !). But the password was not there (or is
it somewhere I did not find?), and I had to find it on another PC, in
archived mails of the axiom-developer list. A bit complicated, and
probably almost impossible to find for a newcomer to Axiom?.

- For next releases, I wonder if it would not be better to use Knoppix
for the core, instead of Fedora ? My PCs are networked to Internet
through an ADSL modem- router, and Knoppix found it so I was able to
connect to Internet without any additional configuration. With the
Doyen CD, I could not connect to Internet and the adress of the
modem-router was detected incorrectly as first DNS address (instead of
gateway, as correctly found by Knoppix).

- The Doyen CD does not recognize hard disks with ntfs partitions
(cannot read) while Knoppix is able to read them.

But maybe there are other PC configs that Fedora would analyze
correctly but not Knoppix, so it is more a question than a
suggestion. Or maybe there are now newer Fedora (I used the latest
Knoppix, dated 2 june 2006).

Anyway, despite these problems, very nice job, thanks a lot !

Wao. It is complicated. We had the intention of changing the password
to something
simpler, like just "doyen". The password is in the Doyen-Wiki but not
that trivial to find.
I will try to have this for the next build of the live cd, together
with more important content
in the front page of the Wiki as suggested by Mr. Bill Page.

There is a version of Doyen using Knoppix 3.7.
http://daly.axiom-developer.org/doyen/ However, the final goal of the
project was to have a Red Hat based Live CD. The Doyen-Knoppix version
does not have a Axiom / LatexWiki. Knoppix has changed very much from
version 3.7 to the latest 4.0.2, especially in the way the Live CD can
be remastered. I would like to try to update this over the summer, and
have the AxiomLatexWiki included.

Very interesting. I have never come across this problem. I will check into it.

I use the Doyen CD and it recognizes my ntfs partitions correctly. Not sure why
it didn't find it in your computer. My first guess is that the autofs
daemon is off. I
will address this.

You are right. It is really a trade off, especially that the creation
of a Fedora CD is faster
and more customizable than Knoppix, but Knoppix has more hardware
support. Actually, Doyen is one of the first Fedora Live CDs I have
seem around. An official one was only achieved last year in Google
Summer of Code, so I think in that sense Knoppix is more mature. I
guess the best thing will be to have best of both worlds (this will
actually be better for people who prefer KDE than Gnome).

Cliff,

As Bill said, the http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/DoyenVirtualMachinePackage
page shows how to boot the Live CD image (iso) using VMware. VMware currently
is the most mature of all the virtualization applications.

Regarding your concern about speed, I only find the booting process a
little bit slower (I
think is something between VMware and Fedora, because other distros
boot faster (Arch) ). After that, I cannot feel much of a difference.
I have used a 1.2 Ghz computer (Celeron) with 512MB, so you can see
that it is not very demanding and could be faster in newer machines.

Thanks. I am running Kubuntu. It used to be that any good distro would
always default to installing all the development tools. Recently they seem
not to do that and I'm not used to that fact.They tend now to leave out

Each of the above pages in turn might lead to 1 or 2 more
pages that you might want to include. I would set a limit
at about 50 or 60 pages in total.

All of these pages with have to be reviewed to make sure they
continue to make sense in the context of the CD. But my advice
would be to not to worry too much about the overall integrity
of the content at this stage. Pehaps you can include a disclaimer
on the FrontPage to the effect that these pages are merely
"a selection" of pages available at on the Axiom developer
wiki. Creating really useful content is going to be a long term
project and hopefully you will be able to attract the help of
additonal people.

You might want to advertise on the FrontPage that people can
send you their updates and corrections to these pages.

Yes I think so. It is based on the September 2005 sources for
Axiom, but it is exactly what we are still running in the
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org site right now. I especially like
the idea of including Aldor on the Doyen CD although it is not
(yet) completely open source.

Are you actually planning to run this version of Axiom+Aldor to
allow the use of \begin{aldor} ... \end{aldor} on the DoyenCD?
Or just have it there for local installation?

Great.

Of course users will also need some of the installation
instructions from the AxiomDownload page. I am thinking that
perhaps we need a set of "liner notes" for the CD that describe
very briefly how to use it.

You will notice that I recently uploaded a draft CD label at

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/DoyenCD

I think a little more effort could easily produce a better
label.

Jose, Wilken,

I'm about to start burning Doyen CDs for ISSAC.

I expect to burn about 150 depending on time and success rate.

It would be great if we had a printable page that contains
"introductory information" that I can put in the envelope
with the CD. It should just point out how to start it,
where to find installable programs and what the root password is.
It would help to mention CAISS. In fact, if Gilbert agrees you
could send me a copy of the page on CAISS letterhead and I can
make copies for insertion. That's up to Gilbert but I think the
exposure at ISSAC is important both for your careers and CAISS.

I'm going to use the HP LightScribe CD (the one that burns a
label directly onto the CD) so it all looks professional.

Assuming you have no objections the CD will have both of your 
names burned in front surface. Let me know if this is ok.

Thanks to Martin's "push" I took the time to re-compile Axiom
with the newest sources (tla update) and re-built the Axiom-Aldor
interface. This version is now installed on the Axiom wiki and
can be downloaded from:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/public/axiom-aldor-20060621.tgz

This tarball contains both Axiom and Aldor. It is a direct
replacement for the previous version you are using in the Doyen
CD. You should have no problem dropping it in to the existing
iso file.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Since you installed the axiom-aldor binary, this now works fine
with the new Doyen CD and also on VMWare Player.

Besides installing Aldor, to get Aldor to work with Axiom
you need to follow the procedure at

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AldorForAxiom

This has already been done in the binary tarball

I also find xdvi rather inconvenient; I think kdvi is much better.
I usually use dvips and view ps by gv (a front end to ghostscript).
If you prefer pdf, I think it's better to use dvipdfm.

"doyen" would be OK for French. It seems (from images of other keyboards I=

Internet) that it would not be OK for German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish=

after rechecking, I could ping to external sites from a terminal, so the p=

perhaps it has to do rather with incorrect (or not done?) configuration of=
 Firefox and other 
software (or my bad knowledge of Fedora :-). But definitely, it did not wo=

Ah, so it is a more subtle problem. The exact problem is : a 250Gb sata di=
sk under ntfs is 
detected as hard disk but not readable (while it is by Knoppix). On the ot=

120Gb sata drive under fat32 that is readable, so it might be that sata dr=

large disks (>130Gb) ? I did not find time to go on Fedora site, download =
and check if it is 
solved with the new version, and signal the pb if not solved already. Sure=
 it will be corrected 
in some next version, as with Knoppix.

It's packaged. See:
http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=advi&sea=
rchon=names&subword=1&version=all&release=all

So you need to activate universe and multiverse in
your /etc/apt/sources.list. Attached is a sources.list sample for
Dapper. Do not forget to "sudo apt-get update" after changing this file.

To find a package which contain dvi in its name you can do (man
apt-cache):

apt-cache -n search dvi

I'm trying to build Silver Axiom on Gentoo Linux. I downloaded the

two occasions I think). I suspect this has to do with LaTeX getting
confused while building the bookvol1.  Somethink is wrong
somewhere with bookvol1.tex but I never got to figure out what.

When the axiom build dies in the documentation there is an
error in the latex and latex has put up a prompt. Because of
"noise reduction" you don't see the prompt. Type 'X' and it
should continue.

To find the error you need to run Latex in its normal noisy mode. Do

 make NOISE=

and you'll see the latex output. Alternatively you can just extract
the latex from the pamphlet, latex the result, and see the error.
The SVN should never contain bad latex.

I am trying to run Doyen inside qemu, however the option -user-net
does not exist.
-net user[options] is there. I would like to know if this is the one
you used and if
the network card worked, with what options.

... anymore.

Actually, when using the qemu in Debian sarge (Version=A0:
0.6.1+20050407-1), this option was useful to get net access.

I have not yet tried doyen with the qemu in Debian sid (Version 0.8.1,
see http://packages.qa.debian.org/q/qemu.html) but with other similar
tests I found that simply drop this (old) option (that has vanished
from newer qemu) was enough (even as a user... but it might be some
magic from the default Debian qemu configuration).
