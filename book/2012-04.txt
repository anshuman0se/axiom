Subject: A quick question about finite fields and polynomials

Hello,

I'm just looking at axiom again after some years, and I've run into a
little conundrum.  I have two objects, an element u of the finite field
FF(7,4), and the defining polynomial f of that field.  Thus:

(67) -> u
(67) ->
            3      2
   (67)  5%A  + 5%A  + %A
                                                       Type:
FiniteField(7,4)
68) -> f
(68) ->
          4
   (68)  ?  + ? + 1
                                Type: SparseUnivariatePolynomial PrimeField
7

What I want to do is to coerce both objects to polynomials over PF 7, so
that I can factorize the result.  I want something like

(69) -> factor(5*b^3+5*b^2+b+b^4+b+1::POLY PF 7)
(69) ->
   (69)  (b + 1)(b + 2)(b + 3)(b + 6)
                                       Type: Factored Polynomial PrimeField
7

But how can I obtain the polynomial in expression (69) without typing it
in; that is, from u and f directly?

I'm using FriCAS here, but AXIOM should most probably be the same.

In interpreter that is easy:

(1) -> fF := FiniteField(7,4)                                      

   (1)  FiniteField(7,4)
                                                                   Type: Type
(2) -> pF := PrimeField(7)              

   (2)  PrimeField(7)
                                                                   Type: Type
(3) -> u := (5*b^3+5*b^2+b+b^4+b+1)::SparseUnivariatePolynomial(fF)

         4     3     2
   (3)  ?  + 5?  + 5?  + 2? + 1
                           Type: SparseUnivariatePolynomial(FiniteField(7,4))
(4) -> u::SparseUnivariatePolynomial(pF)                           

         4     3     2
   (4)  ?  + 5?  + 5?  + 2? + 1
                              Type: SparseUnivariatePolynomial(PrimeField(7))

In Spad you need to use:

   map((c : fF) : pF +-> retract(c)@pF, u)$UnivariatePolynomialCategoryFunctions2(fF, SUP fF, pF, SUP pF)

In more complex cases you may need PolynomiaCategoryLifting.

since about two weeks now http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/

no longer hosted by a computer of the sage progject.

Looks like nobody is using these sites. There were no complaints so far.

Is there someone (besides Bill Page who thankfully invested quite a lot

If there is a site backup I can re-host the pages.
There is a lot of work invested that should not be lost.

I freqently look at Axiom wiki and I noticed that it is down.  I did
not complain because recently there were several transient
problems with sage site and I hoped that the problem will
soon go away.

Concerning question from the subject: ultimately it is up to
authors if they prefer to write for PanAxiom site or put
material elsewere.  When I tried I did not succeed editing
Axiom wiki so I gave up, but apparantly for lot of folks
it worked.

Regardless of current and future preferences of authors,
it would be shame to loose material accumulated in Axiom
wiki, so I wish the site back.

You can download the VirtualBox virtual machine image from these URLs:

http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/page/vm/billpage.ovf
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/page/vm/billpage.mf
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/page/vm/{ba2c36ba-ef4f-4f02-aaf2-9e030d1741c0}.vmdk
http://boxen.math.washington.edu/home/page/vm/{f9328645-093a-4573-8c60-f71cccd07e07}.vmdk

But beware that the last an most essential of these files is about 12
GB.  If you have access to the sage site it might be better to use scp
or something like that.  Look for /scratch/bill.

If you or anyone else would like help getting the VM up and running,
please let me know. I would be glad to help.

Bill Page.

You should have the 4 files together in a directory somewhere. After
setting up VirtualBox use the VirtualBox File/Import Applicance wizard
to import the .ovf file.  VirtualBox will expand the .vmdk files into
about an 80 Gb. or more so be sure you have more than enough disk
space. I have only run this on host machines with Intel 64-bit
architectures. I do not know if the virtual machine will work on an
AMD platform but VirtualBox might be able to cope with the difference.

Once you have the vm up and running, you should be able to http to
localhost:11000.  For public access I setup an apache proxy frontend
webserver on the host machine. If you want to do that I can send you
my standard httpd.conf files. Some of the larger downloadable files
linked to on the site are actually served directly by the apache
frontend for reasons of efficiency.  These files are not included in
what you downloaded so far.

Bill.
