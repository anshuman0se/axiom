Subject: [Axiom-developer] Boot syntax

Steele and Gabriel [0], among the many "fathers" of Common Lisp, make
the following observation

  "On the other hand, precisely because Lisp makes it easy to play
\begin{verbatim}   with program representations, it is always easy for the novice
   to experiment with alternative notations. Therefore we expect
   future generations of Lisp programmers to continue to reinvent
   Algol-style syntax for Lisp, over and over and over again, and
   we are equally confident that they will continue, after an initial
   period of infatuation, to reject it. (Perhaps this process should
   be regarded as a rite of passage for Lisp hackers.)"

Boot was created in the 1970s during the early, novice lisp work.
After 30+ years of Common Lisp, Axiom is no longer in the "novice"
category.

Bjarne gave a 2014 Keynote talk about what we have learned from C++
http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2014/Keynote
in which he talks about programmers. At about 28 minutes in he says:

  "Language Myths. We want a language for writing reliable code.

   NO! Most programmers, most of the time, scream in horror when
   they have to do something extra for reliability, dependability,
   maintainability, all the good stuff. And most programmers don't
   actually care. They just ship when they are told to ship. I wish
   we were in a field with general professionalism but I don't see
   much sign of it. This is not good."

     -- Bjarne Stroustrup

Axiom is a long term project with goals of being reliable and
dependable (computer algebra test suites, regression testing, solid
mathematical underpinnings, program proofs) and, especially, 
maintainable (literate programming). We are trying to deliver
high quality, professional software.

Like Bjarne, I really believe we need to lead the field by
striving for high standards of professionalism with reliable,
dependable, and maintainable software.

History, actually. At one point Axiom was going to use an open
source dvi viewer as part of the hyperdoc interface. Thus all
pamphlets were translated to a dvi final format.

The later transition from standalone pamphlets to book format
introduced PDF files and dvipdfm.

And rigor, I suppose? pdf format is not frozen, pdf viewers are not=20
bug-free. Remember an RMLL conference in Metz where the pdf file of a=20

You misunderstood my question about dvipdfm.

I don't like .dvi and .pdf. These are binary formats. Source counts.

It probably doesn't depend on dvipdfm whether one can do

  latex book.tex

and

  pdflatex book.tex

to optain .dvi and .pdf at the same time.

I had an effort (still unfinished in my 'fricas-book' branch) to revive
the AXIOM book.

http://www.hemmecke.de/fricas/book.pdf

My .sty file

https://github.com/hemmecke/fricas/blob/fricas-book/src/doc/fricas.sty

doesn't use dvipdfm, although (because of eps figures) the translation
also goes .tex -> .dvi -> .pdf and not straight to .pdf.

I am simply not sure whether Tim needs dvipdfm at all and wanted to give
him a hint to try without it.

The sources are available and the binaries are built from the sources
for the books, just like the binaries for Axiom are built from the
sources in the books. Latex macros I've written (like the chunk
environment) live in the axiom.sty file.
 
All of the latex sources are in the books directory. These books also
contain all of the algebra, C code, and the bulk of the interpreter
and compiler code. Eventually the whole src and other directories will
disappear into literate book form.

PDF is widely used, available on all platforms, and is a published
format that anyone can implement so it seems reasonably stable
despite buggy viewers. I don't have an opinion about liking it.

Historically Axiom was going to support a dvi viewer as part of
the new front end. That effort died but the discussion is still
in the mailing list.

See, for instance, the exchange between Michel Lavaud and David Mentre
on 5 May 2003.

It is trivial to ship .dvi files. They are created during the build
and erased as a final cleanup. All we need to do is keep them around.

I'm not sure I need it either and I appreciate the suggestion.  For
the short term I patched the problem by supplying the missing dvipdfm.def 
file. I can't change to dvipdfmx because it isn't backward compatible.
Time will change that decision but the patch will work for now.

Only the books use dvipdfm. It is not used in the src/input files,
for instance. I used it because I am embedding or planning to embed
URLs, eps images, pstricks diagrams, inline animation and inline video,
all of which I have in local repos.

There are certainly other ways to do this. It just hasn't been an
issue until now.

If anyone is feeling ambitious and cares enough it is easy to 
experiment. All of the dvipdfm files are books/bookvol*pamphlet.
The Makefile that controls the latex/dvi/pdf is books/Makefile.
So the problem is really well contained. Make a change, test it,
and post a diff -Naur patch to the mailing list.

Ah, I see, OK. In theory, in a world with perfect humans, I would
completely agree with you. But in practice, in a world with imperfect
humans, source is often insufficient: I could cite many tex sources of
colleagues that did not compile because they used files that were not
available anymore; I have seen also style files, one particular version
of it broke representation of mathematical formulas. In these cases, dvi
saves from starting from zero. So, I would say the couple source and dvi
are indispensable in an imperfect world. Creating output versions in
pdf, html, epub etc. is of course a plus, and one of these (and no dvi)
may be quite sufficient for a thriller author because an error can be
corrected automatically by the brain of the reader. But for mathematics
and works that need rigor and for which the brain cannot automatically
correct errors : I think the best is still to have source and dvi (and
pdf as a plus, but not as a replacement). This is, by the way, the
approach also used for ArXiV (if it didn't change recently).

Arrrrh... again this reality... as a mathematician that's usually to be

Yes. I didn't say that one shouldn't publish dvi or pdf or even html.
But I would rather aim at producing a proper source so that it will also
work in 10 or even 50 years from now without change and produce the same
dvi or pdf. LaTeX is rather stable, so there is some chance to achieve that.

But, in fact, if text breaks because of I change a formatting parameter
from 14 cm to 15 cm width, then that author must be punished. LaTeX
allows to write content and leave the formatting to the .sty file. If
people still haven't learned that lesson, then it's a really imperfect
world. ;-)

How can one be sure that the text (when formatted for html) is still
showing the same content?

And yes, .sty files can be a pain. TeX and LaTeX are not the fanciest
languages to program in. It's too easy to write a working package and
unknowingly break something in some other package.

Steven,

I'm working on your high-parameter fit equations for the expontial integral.

In the 10 parameter fit section you have a constant D_1 which
is ambiguous. The paper reads:

D_1 - 1.01421240602993130D-03

this can be parsed 2 ways:

D_1 =   1.01421240602993130D-03
D_1 = - 1.01421240602993130D-03

which depends on either a mistyped = symbol (first case)
or a missing = symbol (second case).

Which one did you mean?

You asked about the full graph for categories at some point in the past.
In books/bookvol10.2.pamphlet, at the end, is the chunk dotfull.
This chunk collects the subparts of the category graph from Category
book (vol 10.2) into one place. Extracting this chunk will create a
graphviz "dot" file for further processing.

Each category has a dotfull chunk with its part of the graph.
For instance, A1AGG.dotfull.

Oh no... I don't want that. I want the result, but not code a .dot file

The javascript code is at
http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/axiomgraph/js/axiomcode.js

You can get all of the code in
  src/axiom-website/axiomgraph
in a git clone of Axiom and, yes, the info is static (see algebra.json).
I used tools to generate the json. There is an axiomgraph.tex file that
begins to describe it all.

Somehow it seems to me we need to have the graphical tools
like the graphs I've drawn presented "closer to the end user".
That is, we're showing Axiom to Axiom users but not relating
it to mathematics, similar to the Mathworld idea (bought by MMA).

It might make sense to use a top level organization already

Handbook of Mathematical Functions.

Not only would this present a face that is more user focused,
it would give us a good idea of missing functionality.

Subject: [Axiom-developer] LLVM to ACL2 translator

This is exciting! 

Hardin, David S; Davis, Jennifer A.; Greve, David A.; McClurg, Dedidiah R.
"Development of a Translator from LLVM to ACL2"
Proc ACL2 (2014) pp163-177
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.1566v1

In our current work a library of formally verified software components
is to be created, and assembled, using the Low-Level Virtual Machine
(LLVM) intermediate form, into subsystems whose top-level assurance
relies on the assurance of the individual components. We have thus
undertaken a project to build a translator from LLVM to the applicative
subset of Common Lisp accepted by the ACL2 theorem prover. Our
translator produces executable ACL2 formal models, allowing us to both
prove theorems about the translated models as well as validate those
models by testing. The resulting models can be translated and certified
without user intervention, even for code with loops, thanks to the use
of the def::ung macro which allows us to defer the question of
termination. Initial measurements of concrete execution for translated
LLVM functions indicate that performance is nearly 2.4 million LLVM
instructions per second on a typical laptop computer.  In this paper we
overview the translation process and illustrate the translators's
capabilities by way of a concrete example, including both a functional
correctness theorem as well as a validation test for that example.

Subject: [Axiom-developer] caching getdatabase info

Ralf,

The getdatabase information is already cached.

If you look at the function getdatabase (line 37473 in bookvol5)
you'll see code groups that look like:

...
  (constructorkind
   (setq stream *interp-stream*)
   (when (setq struct (get constructor 'database))
     (setq data (database-constructorkind struct))))
...

Since we don't need no stinking comments (yet) the above code
handles a request for 

   (getdatabase domain 'constructorkind)

It sets the stream to read to the correct open daase file.
Then it checks the domain for 'database on the symbol-plist
(property list, an association list).

If the data is already in memory it will set 'struct to the data.

The database defstruct is defined in bookvol5 on line 36854, which
actually IS documented.

The 'struct is a common lisp defstruct, consisting of many fields,
one of which is the 'constructorkind field. Accessing a struct uses
the struct name followed by the field name, database-constructorkind

If the data returned is a number then we have not yet actually
fetched the real data, just a numeric index into the KAF file
(daase files are KAF files, Keyed-Access files, aka random access).

So if the data is numeric then we access the file to get the real
data, replace the numeric data with the real data in the cache with

      (constructorkind (setf (database-constructorkind struct) data)

Thus, the next call to 

   (getdatabase domain 'constructorkind)

will fetch the cached data from memory kept on the domain symbol.

Although, my LISP knowledge is too weak, I've seen that (and not
understood). But that is not the place that I need the cache for.

The structure I am building does only use SExpression for things like
'(has R AbelianGroup)' all the rest is data structures in SPAD.

But that's not the point. The point is that I need the full list of
signatures and categories that are "inherited" down to the bottom
BasicType. This "saturated" exports is not available from GETDATABASE.

In my old version, due to a local view, I would have to recompute that
saturation again and again, not very time critical (in contrast to how
long Sphinx runs), but anyway.

I've now put my global hash right into ConstructorData. And that already
seems to work fine. I don't need mutual recursion anymore. Although,...
I'm still interested in why I couldn't get FriCAS to compile such a
simple file.

 "If what you are working on is not important and it is not likely

    -- Richard Hamming "You and your Research"

This talk is worthwhile, by Richard Hamming
http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2014/05/must-see-tech-talks-for-every-programmer.html

Axiom is important, at least in my view, as a vital platform formed in
the collision of mathematics and compuers. There are important goals
worth working on, for example, figuring out how to prove Axiom's
mathematics correct. Reaching milestones in that goal will be an
important advance in the field of computational mathematics.

Building a system that can be understood, maintained, and modifiable by
others will make Axiom a foundation for future computational mathematics.
The task of communicating with the future is important.

Subject: [Axiom-developer] GCL and LLVM

Camm,

I've begun working on proving an Axiom algorithm. I'm looking
at Coq to work the proof at the Spad level and ACL2 to work the
proof at the Lisp level.

Hardin, et.al [Hard14] has published a paper on an LLVM-to-ACL2
translator. Since GCL generates C, this looks like a way to
bridge the proof from Lisp to the hardware.

So, the question is, have you tried hosting GCL on LLVM?

Well, right. But you and I both know that the issue will be the
compiler switches and other "trivial issues", likely to burn up a
month or so of fribitzing around. Sigh.

The time has come to prove something so ... let the fribitzing begin.

Most of the work last year was enhancing the computer algebra test
suite portion of Axiom with Albert Rich's integrals. Other than that
I've been swallowing code into the books, another set of changes that
are not really user-visible. But a new release should happen.

I will roll out a new release and send you an email when it is ready.

Subject: [Axiom-developer] The company you keep

I am doing a detailed review of the Axiom mailing list.

One question of interest is the size and composition of the Axiom
"community". Since this information is only from the mailing list
it only includes people who subscribed and posted or were mentioned.

Note that the "mailing list" actually starts a couple years before
Axiom went public. None of that information is included here.

I've made a list of people who are mentioned on the list in From:,
To:, CC:, or in detailed discussions. Here is the information broken
down by month. Some people only wrote to me off the list and are not
in this compilation. Some people are not included because all I have
is an email address and since I removed all email addresses from this
list they were removed. Some people are not included because they
posted to MathAction and I have no way to recover a name from that
site.

There are 561 names. 

Each month of emails has two numbers in the header, the first is the
number of emails in that month and the second is the total so far.
As of May 2014 there were 19335 postings.

Each line has the date of the first posting by someone, followed by
the month and year of the last posting by that person.

Subject: [Axiom-developer] Axiom on Mac OS X

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

I have cloned the axiom source from github and am attempting to install it
on a OS X 10.9.2.
I followed the instructions on the axiom developer site, running

cd axiom
export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/macosxppc
export PATH=/sw/bin:$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
make

in terminal.

When I run make, i receive the following output,

13 making noweb

I'm on OS X 10.6.8

noweb is actually an external package.

What compiler are you using? 

It looks like the compiler now includes a function called 'getline'
in stdio.h, causing conflict. Likely this will require some 
compiler switch to be added to the build.

It is clear that the symbol 'getline' has been added to stdio
using the Xcode gcc, which is the cause of the problem.

If you have access to different version of gcc it is likely the
problem will go away.

On a more global solution I'm working on removing noweb completely
from the system but it will take a bit of time. Very few files still
use noweb (mostly the Makefiles) and I'm changing that now.

In /usr/include/stdio.h that comes with CYGWIN, we have:

    /* getline - see __getline for now */
and:
    ssize_t _EXFUN(__getline, (char **, size_t *, FILE *));

I tried using the gcc provided by homebrew but the same issue crops up
there as well.

If this is a problem with making noweb, would it be possible to use a
separately installed noweb to build axiom? Homebrew has a noweb package
which installs without any problems. I ask as this could be a stopgap
solution.

Thanks!

P.S. My name is Sarvagnan. Where I come from, there are no last names. The
last name you use is your fathers first name, so I introduce myself using
just my name, giving out my fathers name only when strictly necessary. Due
to the length of the name and the slightly complex pronunciation, I
introduce myself as Sarva.

Using native noweb would be a stopgap solution. Instead I'm rewriting
the code to remove noweb completely. I've implemented all of the noweb
features that Axiom uses in latex.  That means that all pamphlet files
will be native tex files so there is no need to "weave", all that is
needed is tangle which is a trivial function already in Axiom. Axiom
can ")tangle" directly from pamphlet input files at the Axiom prompt.

I should be done this rewrite shortly. I will send you a note when I
finish.

I only asked because I am compiling a list of people who appear on

Subject: [Axiom-developer] Learning Axiom


The nuclear weapons labs (Los Alamos, Livermore) had a mentor-student
relationship where new physicists would spend 10-15 years learning
their craft. Since the end of the cold war most of the senior people
have retired or died. The new people are now "learning" from people
who were never part of the original team and who have never done
primary work, such as designing a weapon that was actually tested.

One of the key problems is that the original team members rarely
wrote down what they knew. As the original team members left a lot
of vital information was lost.

Efforts have been made to embody the information in computer programs
but it is widely acknowledged that the programs are only an
approximation and contain many "fudge factors" and "work-arounds" to
get what is believed to be "the right answers". These factors are
based on experience rather than physics. They are tacit knowledge from
the past with no real justification nor any way to know if they are
still reasonable.

Axiom was originally developed in a similar lab environment. The
IBM team was inventing new ideas. There were no "experienced" 
people. Progress was rapid and chaotic. Nothing was written down.
New team members (e.g. me) learned by mentoring. Eventually the 
team broke up, some died, some retired.

Many "hacks" were added to get the "right answers". These factors
were based on experience rather than mathematics. They are tacit
knowledge from the past with no real justification nor any review
to know if they are still reasonable.

We are in the rather fortunate position that we can review,
document, justify, and prove the code. Indeed, this is the only
way that there can be a community that "learns", that is, a
community where

... learning must be understood as a process of identity formation
    through which unknowing, unschooled novices gradually come to
    understand themselves as contributing, knowing members of a 
    particular community of practice ...

     -- Laura Agnes McNamara, May 2001 [0]

Since the "lab environment" no longer exists the only possible path
for a new person to learn is from documentation. Properly done,
this can form the basis for formal courses, teaching the next
generation.

I don't think it is a compiler problem, nor do I think changing a compiler
is an effective viable longterm fix.  Unfortunately, I can't comment more
-- several years ago, I wrote a dedicated tool to eliminate the requirement
for 'noweb' to extract the chunks when needed; that is what I use in in my
version of AXIOM.

It is clear that the symbol &#39;getline&#39; has been added to stdio<br>

If you have access to different version of gcc it is likely the<br>

On a more global solution I&#39;m working on removing noweb completely<br>

This really makes the algorithm obvious.
If only we could document Axiom's algorithms so clearly...

Wow! is right!!

Now all we have to do is recycle every mathematician's brain
which has been trained for the past seven decades to produce
only opaque symbolic and verbal gibberish.

Same comment for Axiom if it does this.
(I haven't used the output tex option, so I just don't know)

Subject: Re: [Axiom-developer] [fricas-devel] TexFormat with latex output

\begin{array} is the "native" LaTeX book invocation
of an "array" environment; if somebody has added
a "pmatrix" environment, I personally would avoid
using it in anything I wrote unless it is in the
current LaTeX2e (or beyond) standard.

It is a combinatorial impossibility for you, me, or
anyone else to support every major package out there.
Base level Latex is going to be hard enough.

It is impossible to guess the preference of every individual
and supply parameters and switches to have Axiom/FriCAS/OpenAxiom
anticipate the wishlists of the world.

PanAxiom is deaf, dumb, blind, and stupid;
there is no way code a TeX/LaTeX/package-list crystal ball
into it.

The only reason that I would ever use ")set output tex/latex on"
would be to cut-and-paste into a document which in turn would
be edited to suit; there is no way to guess what will be done
to the generated output at that point.

All of which means that package assumptions should not be made
at this time, repeat: at this time.

Get basic stuff correct first.

The same goes for private ".sty" files


Cheers, Gene

Ralf is trying to do something constructive with documentation
and no solution is perfect. I think he should be given the
freedom to experiment. All of these complaints feel like
"bike-shedding".
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bike_shed

That said, anybody using Axiom tex/latex output would be expected
to \usepackage{axiom}. There are Axiom-specific commands that I
have written (such as the chunk environment) and I would expect
to be able to use them in output formats.

The function you want is |genMapCode| in src/interp/i-map.lisp.pamphlet
This calls |reportFunctionCompilation| in src/interp/slam.lisp.pamphlet

It appears to use the variable |$whereCacheList|

Subject: [Axiom-developer] Axiom no longer uses noweb

As of this update Axiom uses native latex chunk syntax.
As a result, noweb has been removed. So

  <<foo>>=   becomes \begin{chunk}{foo}
  <<foo>>    becomes \getchunk{foo}
  @          becomes \end{chunk}
  [[foo]]    becomes \verb|foo|

All of these latex definitions are in books/axiom.sty
so to get the new syntax you need to add

  \usepackage{axiom}

Since pamphlet files are native latex there is no "weave" step.

There is a C and a lisp version of tangle in 
books/tangle.c and books/tangle.lisp. You can do

  gcc -o tangle tangle.c
  tangle foo.pamphlet     -- expands the default chunk marked
                          -- by \begin{chunk}{*}
  tangle foo.pamphlet chunkname
                          -- expands \begin{chunk}{chunkname}


The Axiom interpreter has a new )tangle command to extract
code from an input pamphlet. So given foo.input.pamphlet

  )tangle foo   -- from foo.input.pamphlet => foo.input
  )read foo     -- read foo.input as usual

The document command has been rewritten and renamed to extract.
It is now in books/extract. Running 

  extract foo.pamphlet

will generate foo.pdf

I contacted the authors of the award-winning literate program
book "Physically-Based Rendering" and they have sent me all
of their tools. It is a big pile but I hope to incorporate
some of their magic in future updates.

That is pretty nice. The author is a skilled educator on top of being a
skilled coder. That may be a point to consider with documentation like
this. There is more to it than "documenting" what the code does. If the
goal is explaining, then it becomes educational. I think we all know

Subject: [Axiom-developer] GCL performance

There is an interesting hardware talk about performance myths.

http://highscalability.com/blog/2013/6/13/busting-4-modern-hardware-myths-are-memory-hdds-and-ssds-rea.html?

His perf stat numbers are interesting.

It might be worthwhile thinking about data layouts in memory to
optimize the 64 byte cache line fetches for related data. It is
no more expensive to work on 1 byte than 64 bytes so it might
be useful to introduce some "extension data types" that optimize
layouts. This would give Axiom some control over performance.

Also, packing function pointers or always allocating 64 byte
stack frames might be useful optimizations.

Just a thought. There is no such thing as a simple job.

Subject: Re: [Axiom-developer] TexFormat with latex output

Gene,

I'm well aware of Knuth's missive that "any object of nontrivial
complexity is non-optimum" and that stability is vital. I've already
complained to several people about the Spad syntax changes of ** to ^
and ~= to !=, since I feel these break the published syntax. The Spad
syntax is annoying but not a "serious flaw". 

In fact you've discovered one of the reasons I am so conservative
about language/system changes. Like Knuth, I'd like the code you
write to continue to work 30 years from now.

I have made extensions to the syntax but these are upward compatible.
For example, the -- comments now have special meaning if they are
followed by an uppercase character, although they are still comments.

  --X is used as an examples in Spad comments where you would document
    the gcd function with 

  gcd(PI,PI) -> PI
    -- compute the gcd of two positive integers
    --
    --X gcd(24,18)

The -X lines in the example are output when the user does
  )describe gcd
so the extension adds new documentation output.

  --S , --R, and --E are used as delimiters in input files. The --S
  marks the start of a test case, --R is the expected result line,
  and --E marks the end of a test, as in

    --S 3 of 20
    3*7
    --R 
    --R  (15)  21
    --R                       Type: PositiveInteger
    --E 3

These delimiters are used during regression testing to check that
Axiom gives the same answers as the result lines.

Upward compatible extensions don't violate what is in the Jenks book.

That said, Ralf is doing work in a particular domain on top of Spad.
He is not making changes to the syntax or semantics of the language.
I can see how it could be considered as incompatible though so you
may have a point.

I suppose Ralf's change could be made using a new domain (LatexOutputForm?)
which would leave the existing work intact. A LatexOutputForm domain
could have a coerce to latex function. This would lift the whole issue
away from the )set command.

However, the comments I've seen are mostly bike-shedding. Everybody
has a favorite way to do latex with their favorite packages. It is
easy to propose a different package (e.g. \begin{array} vs matform).
That level of discussion has no principle (e.g. Knuth's serious flaw
vs "because it is pretty") which can be used to resolve the issue.

Ralf is doing great work and I hate to see such discouraging feedback.

Tim

Subject: Re: [Axiom-developer] Hash problems

Greetings!  I've resolved it now, but we should be aware of this going
forward.

axiom currently relies on a broken GCL implementation of functionp,
which incorrectly returns t for fboundp symbols.  axiom uses this to
decide whether to funcall, as in (if (functionp x) (funcall x ...)).
With a correct functionp, as in GCL master, it should read (if (if

already have something like this in |functionp|.  Anyway, when I release
a fix to this eventually, axiom will need to be changed.  Luckily, the
axiom change can occur now with existing gcl as well.

The forthcoming 2.6.11 will still have the broken functionp.

Camm,

This is due to an unfortunate name ambiguity. There is a
|functionp| function (axiom) and a functionp function (lisp).
I renamed |functionp| to canFuncall? which removed the ambiguity
and am testing the fix now.

Thanks for fixinding this.

Subject: [Axiom-developer] TexFormat with latex output

Hi Tim, hi Eugene,

> Ralf is doing great work and I hate to see such discouraging feedback.

It's not (yet) discouraging at all at the moment.

There were several point that made me think.

1) Where is TexFormat actually used?
2) Don't break efricas way of showing rendered latex via
   \usepackage{preview} and dvipng.

Point (2) is rather easy to solve. And it's rather uninteresting by
which means. The only stability question is that it should work.

Point (1) is something, I cannot really answer. I use it to generate the
book form http://fricas.github.io/book.pdf, but otherwise Eugene's
comment "I would never use it", made me think.

TexFormat is not like the other formatters in the sense that there is
also a "latex: % -> String" function

http://fricas.github.io/api/SetCategory.html#l-set-category-latex

Well, that function is often just returning "not implemented" and
therefore not really useful, but somehow I doubt, that a user is going
the path  object -> OutputForm -> TexFormat -> String. I don't even see
how the last arrow would be performed. Would it be latex:TexFormat->String?

So I rather think that interfacing FriCAS to a nice frontend is the only
usecase. So I am asking people for what they use TexFormat.

Actually, neither \begin{pmatrix} nor \begin{array}{ccc} are flexible
enough for my taste. Remember, Franz Lehner rather wants bmatrix.
I'm going to produce a new environment that can be defined to the
respective need of the user.

Only then we have a stable interface from the FriCAS world to the TeX world.

Previously, there were troubles building noweb. Those were resolved with
the new release. However new errors are cropping up.

The first error that cropped up was that gcc could not find malloc.h. I
tried solving this by copying the malloc.h from /usr/include/malloc into
/usr/include. This seemed to fix the error.

The second error was abrupt. After finishing the steps prior, make stops on
lsp BUILDING GCL COMMON LISP.
It then stops with output
make[1]: *** [lspdir] Error 2

There is no output about the reasons for the error.

The version of axiom is the latest axiom-master from github as of

Where can I patch the things? That are relevant to my changes?
In other words: where is it documented what mathaction actually does to
get the latex picture? If there is nothing, can you (as the author)
describe the way you have designed it.

Would I have to patch on Waldek's server directly or would it be enough
to just use a new version of fricas, i.e. all things could be done in
the fricas repository?

Oh... if you use the original awk files from NAGcdrom then my changes
will break everything. For the book I decided to be incompatible with
the original scripts and rather wrote my own scripts to deal with the
new output that I produce in my new TexFormat.

It depends now whether you want to stick to the old scripts and the
original style of the AXIOM book. I would have had to fix some scripts
anyway from NAGcdrom and some seemed to be missing, so I decided to do
it differently and build on LaTeX2e instead of the old LaTeX209. That
simplified quite a lot in the (now) fricas.sty file. I've removed a lot
of redundant definitions and rather built on latex packages that seem to
be pretty standard nowadays.

As for the style. As you see from http://fricas.github.io/book.pdf, the
current style of the book looks totally different from the original
AXIOM book. However, I've kept the original structure. So with a bit of
style file magic, it should be possible to restyle the book similar to
the original AXIOM book. I haven't done that since I think that content
was more important than keeping the original style.

Ralf,

The book looks good. Two comments, though. 

It is possible to change the hyperlinking from using a box around the
link to something more common, like underlining. When rendered in a
small font the box obscures the text.

You might consider using blue as the equation font color rather
than the type color. Blue is strongly recognized as a primary
color so the type stands out above all else on the page. Using
blue as the type color for the input would make that stand out
instead. In most examples, you tend to care more about the input
than the resulting type.

Probably possible. But, that is an issue which IMO is unrelated to
TexFormat. Try to look at the generated book.dvi That is using
underlined links.

One can probably change the boxes by sending some \specials to the
pdfviewer, but I currently don't know how. Maybe there is an option in
the hyperref latex package.

Now, that starts bike-shedding. ;-) I did not really put much emphasis
on chosing the colors wisely. They are just thrown in.

If you are using the hyperref package you can do 
\hypersetup{
colorlinks=false,         % black hyperlinks
linkbordercolor=red,      % hyperlink borders are red
pdfborderstyle={/S/U/W 1} % border style will be underline

I'm partially colorblind so I never use color for anything that
has meaning. Red and green are the same color to me. Blue happens
to stand out. I normally use yellow-on-black for text editing
only because it has high contrast. Methinks a yellow-on-black
book format might use a bit too much printer ink though.

So paint the bike-shed any color as long as it isn't red/green :-)

Thanks for this fast answer. Great to hear that you have
the code and are working on integrating it into Axiom.

I'll try it when it becomes ready.

Even almost 20 years later this is still a very weak
point of todays' CA systems.


BTW: There are some Categories and Domains in Aldors
algebra library representing conditional expressions.
As far as I tried it, this merely a general interface.
I'm sure you already know that.

Greetings!  If using the debian axiom package, you need to install the
package build-dependencies, easiest via apt-get build-dep axiom.  In
particular, you are missing libgmp-dev, required to compile programs
against gmp, as opposed to running programs previously linked against
gmp.

Subject: Re: [Axiom-developer] libgmp not found

Raoul,

http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/download.html

lists the packages Axiom expects to be installed for Debian as:

gcc build-essential debhelper gettext gs-gpl html2text
intltool-debian libgmp3-dev libice-dev libxau-dev libxaw7-dev
po-debconf x-dev x11proto-input-dev x11proto-kb-dev
libreadline5-dev gawk texlive-pstricks git-core texlive

Due to a recent change in the texlive distribution you may also need 

texlive-fonts-extra

If Axiom fails to build after that I'll have to build a debian
machine to debug it.

I was going to ask about that but I wasn't sure if the deprecation was mac
specific. Is there something I can add so that all calls top malloc.h are
negated? Copying malloc.h into usr/include seems like a very messy solution.
Thanks!

Just replace the line that includes malloc.h with

#include <stdlib.h>

Hi,

This is currently in a bit a troublesome state:

 The following packages have unmet dependencies:
  gcl : Depends: binutils (< 2.24.51.20140605) but 2.24.51.20140617-1 is to=
 be installed
 E: Build-dependencies for axiom could not be satisfied.

The binutils package is installed, but gcl is not.
However I have sbcl. (Which works well for Fricas.)

Might this be an issue?

I'm sure I have gmp because I needed it for another
project some time ago. The dpkg tells me there is:

  libgmp-dev:amd64
  libgmp10:amd64
  libgmp3-dev

Afaik libgmp3-dev is just a dummy for libgmp-dev. To me it seems
the library and the headers are all present.


BTW: Sorry for the double post.

Dear Tim,

Unfortunately this list is no longer correct. At least=20
in the unstable / sid branch of Debian, there are several
packages renamed or removed. Trying to apt-get install the=20
above list to check stops with:


  Package libreadline5-dev is not available, but is referred to by another =
package.
  This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
  is only available from another source
  However the following packages replace it:
    libreadline-gplv2-dev:i386 lib64readline-gplv2-dev:i386 libreadline-gpl=
v2-dev

  E: Unable to locate package gs-gpl
  E: Unable to locate package x-dev
  E: Package 'libreadline5-dev' has no installation candidate

It is not urgent for me, so please do not waste your time here.
On the other hand, it might be a problem with the current Debian
development branch which needs to be fixed for new Axiom packages
anyway.
