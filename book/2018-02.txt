Thanks for your report!  I think -nox should work, right?

Tim, something has regressed in the sman socket code.  Does this ring a
bell?

Take care,

YES, thanks for the suggestion.

Hi Tim!  No need to worry about this further as I've fixed it for now.
There is a case issue with the SYS environment variable.  For ages I've
been setting AXIOM to ..../mnt/linux without problem, but recently this
defines PLF as linuxplatform instead of LINUXplatform, breaking many
defines in the sman code.  If the only canonical support is for
..../mnt/LINUX, then so be it and no worries.

Take care,

Oh. That explains why I couldn't reproduce it. --Tim
