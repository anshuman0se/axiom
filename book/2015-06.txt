Subject: [Axiom-developer] Latest release on Docker

A new Docker image was pushed. As usual,

  docker pull daly/axiom
  docker run -i -t daly/axiom axiom

The main change removed the src/interp/interop.lisp.pamphlet file.

This fulfills two project goals, the first goal of moving the code
into literate form and the second goal of cleaning up the code base.
We are one file closer to a fully literate form.

The interop.lisp file contained code to check for and handle data
formats from a prior version of the system. It was intended to be
used during the transition, which was finished long before Axiom
was released. Unfortunately the old code remained.

Not only was this a waste of compile time, it was a waste of runtime
since the checking functions always returned false.

The dead code was removed and the live code was absorbed into other
files.

This should be transparent to users.

Methinks it is time to work on a MathML output package.

Agree. I remember Sam Dooley worked on MathML. Indeed, a 
number of the principal authors had worked on Axiom (Bob 
Sutor, Stephen Watt, for example---you probably recognize 
more).

Principal Authors: Ron Ausbrooks, Stephen Buswell, David 
Carlisle, Giorgi Chavchanidze,
StÃ©phane Dalmas, Stan Devitt, Angel Diaz, Sam Dooley, 
Roger Hunter, Patrick Ion,
Michael Kohlhase, Azzeddine Lazrek, Paul Libbrecht, Bruce 
Miller,
Robert Miner (deceased), Chris Rowley, Murray Sargent, 
Bruce Smith, Neil Soiffer,
Robert Sutor, Stephen Watt

You follow these instructions to install "boot2docker":
https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/

Then you start boot2docker and type:
   docker pull daly/axiom
   docker run -i -t daly/axiom axiom
