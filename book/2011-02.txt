Hi,

For Axiom:

http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/AxiomBinaries axiom-windows-0.1.4.exe

There is no native support for Axiom in Windows. Many of the issues
you are reporting are because of this and not because of the other
projects. So this file should probably be removed as it does not
reflect the Axiom project at http://axiom-developer.org. I will remove
it. For Axiom support in Windows you should follow:

http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/download.html

For Fricas:

http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/FriCASBinaries Fricas-Rev.263.exe

was an attempt to make an installer for Fricas, and it required to
have an AXIOM variable. Note that this file was never distributed by
the Fricas project and it was just something uploaded to the wiki in
case people wanted to try it. There was no intention to harm other
projects. The wiki page has now been updated= .  Proper support in
Windows for Fricas is done by using Cygwin.

http://fricas.sourceforge.net/download.html

For OpenAxiom:

OpenAxiom has the only current installer on Windows that I know
of. OpenAxiom "does not use the AXIOM variable" since the project was
started almost. I will make sure today that this is the case in the
installer and it was not something left from the old plugin to
texmacs. If that is the case I will fix this ASAP.

Again these installers were not created by any of the projects and in
no way it means you cannot have all 3 projects in your computer.

Subject: re: Axiom on Windows

I just installed the OpenAxiom installer:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/open-axiom/files/open-axiom-1.3.0-windows-i=
386.exe

As I expected, there is no AXIOM variable being installed:

(1) -> )system %AXIOM%
'%AXIOM%' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

The commands not working for you:

(1) -> )cd
   The current OpenAxiom default directory is C:/OpenAxiom/bin/

(1) -> )cd c:\temp
   The current OpenAxiom default directory is c:/temp/

I will try reading the input file later, as this is something I have
not done before in Windows.

Let me know if you have questions, and for problems with the
installer you can report it in one of the OpenAxiom mailing lists:

http://www.open-axiom.org/lists.html

To all --

In the interest of cutting down the amount of FUD one can find
here and there: OpenAxiom-1.3.x does not depend
on user setting an AXIOM environment variable.

Said differently, whether you set or not set AXIOM variable
does not affect the behaviour of OpenAxiom.  Nor installing
OpenAxiom should affect it.

Subject: Axiom on Windows

Hi

I am new to Axiom and am trying to use it on Windows 7, 64-bit.  (I am 
experienced with Mathematica but have never previously used Axiom.) 
Most of the bits and pieces to make this work appear to be out there, 
but are not very well documented or easy to find.  Clearly, several 
people have taken the time to make installers, etc.  Surely someone is 
actually using it successfully on Windows.

I myself have it working to some extent.  This is what I did:

Downloaded:

http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/AxiomBinaries
axiom-windows-0.1.4.exe

http://sourceforge.net/projects/open-axiom/files/
open-axiom-1.3.0-windows-i386.exe

http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/FriCASBinaries
Fricas-Rev.263.exe

I installed them in the order OpenAxiom, FriCAS, Axiom (not having much 
information on which of the three to use).  They all installed and made 
desktop shortcuts.  The ones for OpenAxiom and Axiom, more or less 
worked from the shortcuts with the command-line interface.  The one for 
FriCas failed with a socket error ("can't open socket listing file"). 
They all put their paths in PATH, which could possibly be a problem.  I 
uninstalled FriCAS.  The others I installed and reinstalled as I found 
one did some things right and the other other things right.  Currently 
they are both installed with Axiom first in the PATH.

I got the QT windows version of TeXmacs.

http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/TeXmacs
texmacs-installer.exe

I got it running.  It is apparently set up for Axiom.  I cloned the 
axiom plug-in and made it work for OpenAxiom using snippets of 
information gleaned via the web.  So I can now run both as sessions in 
TeXmacs.  Axiom works better for me.  I can, in fact, do a lot of what 
Axiom as a CAS is supposed to do.

The main problem with TeXmacs is that when it is covered by another 
window, clicking on the title bar causes it to maximize, rather than 
just coming on top -- very annoying.

The main problem I have right now with the CAS is that I cannot get it 
to read .axiom.input.  I would like to do this to, at a minimum, set my 
working directory to "My Documents/Axiom" where I expect to keep my 
.input files.  This is what happens (with Axiom in the command-line 
interface to keep it simple):

1. )cd doesn't work

(1) -> )cd

    >> System error:
    Cannot get the truename of #p"~/".

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
(1) ->

Using ")system ls", I can see that I am in "My Documents, actually 
c:\Users\evans\Documents.  I would guess Axiom didn't do this as it 
doesn't seem to know it (Axiom) is there.  It is probably some kind of 
windows default.

)cd Axiom doesn't work.  In fact, nothing I have tried works except:

)cd c:/Users/evans/Documents/Axiom

Even after that )cd still doesn't work, but )read 
<filename-without-path> works.

Before doing that )cd Axiom or ./Axiom didn't work.

Is there some way to get around this?  Note that $HOME is defined as 
c:\Users\evans\Documents.  You would think it might try $HOME if ~ fails.

2. It does not read .axiom.input.  I have tried putting it where it 
should be (c:\Users\evans) in "My Documents" and in other places.  Does 
anyone know how to make it read .axiom.input.

These are some things from the environment that might be applicable:

HOME=c:\Users\evans
HOMEDRIVE=C:
HOMEPATH=\Users\evans
LOCALAPPDATA=C:\Users\evans\AppData\Local
OPENAXIOM=C:/Program Files 
(x86)/OpenAxiom/lib/open-axiom/i686-pc-mingw32/1.3.0

Tim,

Thanks for the response.  The name is Ken, though.  Actually I installed 
Axiom last.  I just now  uninstalled OpenAxiom, leaving only Axiom just 
to eliminate uncertainty.  Only Axiom is in the PATH and $OPENAXIOM is 
no longer there.  I still have the same problems with .axiom.input and )cd.

Subject: GCL and GMP

I have an OLPC XO box running fedora.  It has gmp4 installed on the
system.  GCL looks for gmp.h which does not exist and therefore the
build is failing.  The internal version of gmp3 does not have gmp.h
either but the build seems to require a file "gmp.h".

Why is this test there?

It is a question of domains. In Axiom you can specify the domains.

2/1 is a Fraction(Integer) aka rational
4 is an Integer
(2/1)::Integer => 2 where 2 is an Integer.
4::Fraction(Integer) is a Fraction(Integer) 

So there are several cases:
gcd((2/1),4::Fraction(Integer)) => 1 of type Fraction(Integer)
gcd((2/1)::Integer,4))          => 2 of type PositiveInteger
gcd(2/1,4)                      => 1 of type Fraction(Integer)
gcd(2,4)                        => 2 of type PositiveInteger
gcd(2,4::Fraction(Integer))     => 1 of type Fraction(Integer)

That's why I was asking for an algorithm for gcd and lcm
in the subdomain. I'm not sure what answer is expected.
The unit (1) is correct but not by your definition, and
apparently not helpful for the original poster.

I haven't been paying close attention but I think the following might work:
define the gcd() implicitly: i.e. minimize over [m,n integer,G>0]( 
m(a/b)+n(c/d))=G
This seems to make sense in Euclidean domains.
This leads to
G=gcd(da,bc)/bd
let's see how this works
gcd(1/4,1/6) would yield 2/24=1/12
gcd(3/12,9/54) would yield gcd(3*54,12*9)=gcd(3*9*6,3*4*9)=3*9*2
3*9*2/(3*4*9*6)=1/12

So it seems consistent.
Sorry if this is off-topic or I have overlooked something obvious.  Of 
course the actual reasonableness and verification needs proof.
I think I have developed a formalism that makes sense over Principal 
Ideal Rings, extended  to include inverses.  Bur the ideas are not  
mathematically well defined.
