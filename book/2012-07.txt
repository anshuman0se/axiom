Sirs,
Im trying to install May2012 buit in my debian system. I had installed a pr=
evious built and it worked fine.
I have gNewSense 2.3 Debian distro and the make ends with following lines:

I suspect you are having a problem with SELinux.

See faq items 47 which says
   As root do:
     echo 0 >/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
   or do
     setarch i386 -R make

You may also be having exec-shield issues.

See faq item 36 and 37:

   echo 0 >/proc/sys/kernel/exec-shield

Subject: TeX output of a**bc

Hello,

by accident I noticed the following irregularity in the TeX output
(missing {}):

a**bc (or a^bc).

Axiom:
$$
a^bc
\leqno(4)
$$

OpenAxiom, Fricas:
$$
a \sp bc
\leqno(6)
$$

Usually, one uses only one character variables :)
I'm using Axiom mostly via Python (TeXmacs, IPython) so that 
  re.sub(r"\\sp ([^ \t\r\n\f\v\\]*)", r"^{\1}", tex)
is a workaround for the moment.

Yes, indeed. I didn't even think of the interpretation as a^{b c}
because in fact c were integers in my examples, so it didn't attract
much attention when rendered, but it's definitively not to distinguish
when c is literal. I have to review my workaround.

Thank you for pointing this out.

In the case c is literally an integer, and b is a symbol, 
then most likely c is meant to be a single subscript---of 
course, it could also be a superscript, but we can't tell. 
For subscript, the TeX code would be $a^{b_{c}}$. If c is 
meant to be a double subscript, like b13 to mean b_{1,3}, 
then it may be necessary to pass the integer string c.

Rather than guessing what the user has in mind, in case it 
is a^b13, I think your workaround a^{b13} is fine. Or you 
can use \verbatim to capture Axiom input and output lines.

Subject: Re: TeX output of a**bc

To tell the whole story, I've written a new TeXmacs plugin for Axiom (in
Python) that displays only the TeX output, which latter I expected to be
reliable. To obtain nice output (subscripted exponents) I enter for example

  a^b__1 => Axiom removes one underscore =>  TeX output $$a^b_1$$

hence I see in fact an {a_1}^b rendered instead of a^{b_1}. Strange
enough, a^(x+bc), a^(x+b*c), a^(b*c) or a^123 produce correct output
(Axiom inserts an extra space in case of *). By the way, there is no
difference using tex or latex to compile. I think adding the missing
braces would at least give correct math output (modulo the ambiguity in
products/multichar identifiers you remarked earlier).

Thank you for your interest.
Kurt

(4) -> a^(x+b*c)

         x + b c

Greetings!  Yes, you are using an older gcc version.

gcc -v

Any chance of upgrading?  If not, I can show you how to work around
this.

Dear Axiom Gurus,

there seems to be again some interests on cylindrical algebraic
decomposition and I wanted to recompile my CAD package which is
available at 

http://rioboo.free.fr/CadPub/

The package compiles and runs under open-axiom.

Unfortunatly I was not able to install axiom. System

Under which license do you distribute your package? Maybe it makes sense 
to allow any of AXIOM, FriCAS, and OpenAxiom to include it into their 
library base. Of course, your license would have to be compatible with 
the modified BSD license under which the 3 systems are currently 
distributed.

I met Renaud at CICM 2012 in Bremen this week.  We have had chats
about AXIOMs, and he definitely wants his package to be distributed as
widely as possible.  I just woke up after an unusually long night, so
I have not been able to answer all of his questions yet.
I need some coffee and I will get back to him :-)
